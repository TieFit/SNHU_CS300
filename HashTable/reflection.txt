The purpose of this code is to utilize a hash table to store and manage bids read from a CSV file. The hash table uses chaining via a linked list to handle collisions and sort through
bids contained within the hash table. It also contains basic functionalities such as: 
1. loading bids 
2. displaying bids 
3. finding a bid
4. removing a bid

Throughout this assignment I did not encounter many challenges except for when it came to the search and remove functions. The primary issue I was encountering during this was deleted
bids persisting afterwards. To be precise, if I deleted a bid and then searched for the deleted bid, it should not appear. However, the bid would still appear, alongside with an output 
message saying it was deleted. However, it's certainly not deleted if any information of the bid is being displayed. To prevent this I added some extra steps to my remove function. 
Firstly, I flagged the current node as deleted using current->deleted = true. I also set the current key as being empty using current->key = UINT_MAX. By doing this I could then 
add conditional statements in the search function to check for the status of these values. If current->deleted == true or current->key = UINT_MAX, it would then output a message saying
which value was detected as such and end the function before other information could be output.
