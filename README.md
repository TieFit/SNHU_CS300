1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The primary problem solved during this course was utilizing various data strcutures to properly handle and store data read from a CSV file. 

   
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached this problem by doing my best to learn more of the data structure I was implementing for each particular assignment. For example, learning its strengths and weakness and its use cases for various situations. 

   
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I overcame roadblocks encountered by referencing materials in my textbook and using resources online such as StackOverflow to deepen my understanding of the concept at hand, so I was adequately prepared to accurately troubleshoot the issues I had. 

   
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project has broadened my horizons by giving me exposure to various data structures such as vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. Through learning more about these data structures I believe I have fostered a deeper understanding
  than what I had previously. 

   
6. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I would not necessarily say my way of writing programs has evolved through this course, however I will say that it has strengthened the way in which I currently do so. Getting exposure to more complex topics, as well as simply programming in general has
    given myself good exposure and practice which has aided me in improving.
