The code's purpose is to manage bid objects through the usage of a binary search tree. Bid objects are parsed from a csv file and then translated into a BST where they can be 
loaded, displayed, removed and new ones can be added. By utilizing a binary search tree for this, the bid objects are able to be managed efficiently.

Throughout this assignment I honestly did not face many challenges. The pre-existing instructions in the starter code were thorough to the point of it taking most of the thought out
of planning what to write. One challenge I did encounter however was getting the CSV file to load and display properly. At this point I honestly have no idea why I have been struggling
with the same thing so much. I have faced this same issue throughout the previous assignments as well. What is especially confounding is it seems like every assignment I find a different
way to fix it, and each way never works twice. During last week's assignment, HashTable, I did not need to do a single thing and it worked flawlessly from the start. This time however,
all I did was delete my project and start a new one. I quite literally kept my exact same files and code, line for line, when creating the new one, and for whatever reason it was fully 
functional after doing so. So at this point the only logical conclusion is that my computer is sentient and is purposefully messing with me for laughs. In all seriousness though, I
was able to overcome this challenge and was able to get the program functioning as intended, at the end of the day that matters most.
